<h2>Game Description</h2>
<p>Roll for Great Old Ones is a unique game in which players draft dice<br> out of a general pool to program actions on their investigator board. Thus leaving<br> behind "cultist dice", which will trigger actions during the scenario.<br>
    The investigators have to negotiate which dice to use and which to leave<br> behind, knowing quite well what might happen.</p>
