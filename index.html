    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you
        around.<br> The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the
        point where they explode. [...]</p>

            least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.<br>
